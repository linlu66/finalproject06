## Introduction
  I am curious about whtat people say about the restaurant in Boston on twitter,so I did data mining about restaurant in Boston on twitter.In this project, I combine mining a social networking service(twitter), mapping and shiny.

## Wordcloud
  I am interested in the words that people use to decribe the restaurant in Boston,so I use the wordcloud package and tm package in R to make a wordcloud.


##  Mapping
  In this part, I use streamR package and ggmap package to show the geographic location of the tweetS captured.

## shiny
 In this part, I made a interacitve website to show the wordcloud image and mapping image.
